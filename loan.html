                <h2>EMMA REMENZ</h2>
                <P>Diana wasn’t created in the traditional “birds and the bees” act of procreation 
                    that we mere mortals are familiar with. In many of her earliest incarnations 
                    the Amazonian princess was created by Queen Hippolyte’s hands and a lump of clay. 
                    In the 1940s this was one way to avoid the issues biological issues related to 
                    progeny on an island full of women, plus it avoided the uncomfortable issues related 
                    to homosexuality in that era.<br>Gadot was born on 30 April 1998 in Petah Tikva,
                    Israel,[note 1] where she first lived. [18] She was later raised in the city of Rosh HaAyin,
                     Israel.[6] In Hebrew, her first name means "wave" and her surname means "riverbanks"
                     [4] Her parents are Irit (née Weiss), a physical education teacher, and Michael Gadot, 
                     an engineer;[19] they Hebraized their surname from "Greenstein" to "Gadot" prior to her birth.
                     [20][21] She has a younger sister, Dana Gadot.[22][23] Gadot has stated that she was brought up 
                     in a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment,"[19] and is of Ashkenazi Jewish[5] descent 
                     (Polish-Jewish, Austrian-Jewish, German-Jewish, and Czech-Jewish).[7] Her father is a sixth-generation Sabra.
                     [24] Gadot's maternal grandparents were born in 20th-century Europe; her grandfather, who
                      was imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, 
                      survived the Holocaust,while her grandmother managed to escape the continent before the outbreak 
                      of World War II hostilities.
